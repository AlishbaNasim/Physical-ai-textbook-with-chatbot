# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This comprehensive guide bridges large language models, perception, and robot control in simulated and real-world humanoid systems.

## About This Book

This textbook is designed for advanced undergraduate and graduate students, AI engineers, robotics developers, and educators with a computer science or AI background. The content covers:

- How AI systems transition from digital intelligence to embodied, physical agents
- ROS 2 as the nervous system of humanoid robots
- Simulation-first development using Gazebo, Unity, and Isaac Sim
- Integration of LLMs for conversational and cognitive robotics
- Practical implementation of autonomous humanoid systems

## Learning Objectives

After completing this textbook, you will be able to:

- Explain the principles of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- Implement ROS 2-based control systems for humanoid robots
- Design simulation environments for robot development
- Integrate large language models with robotic control systems
- Conceptually complete an autonomous humanoid capstone project

## Navigation

This textbook is organized into four main modules:

1. **Physical AI Foundations** - Core concepts of embodied intelligence
2. **ROS 2 - The Nervous System** - Robot operating system fundamentals
3. **Simulation-First Development** - Virtual-to-reality workflows
4. **VLA & Conversational Robotics** - Advanced AI integration

Each module contains 3-4 chapters with clear learning objectives, technical explanations, diagrams, and practical examples.

## Using the RAG Chatbot

Throughout this textbook, you'll find an integrated chatbot that can answer questions based strictly on the content in this book. The chatbot will:

- Provide accurate answers grounded in textbook content
- Acknowledge when questions fall outside the book's scope
- Guide you to relevant sections when appropriate

Begin your journey by exploring the first module on Physical AI Foundations.
