# Module 2: ROS 2 - The Nervous System

This module covers the Robot Operating System (ROS 2) as the nervous system of humanoid robots, focusing on communication frameworks, message passing patterns, and control architectures.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Explain the role of ROS 2 in humanoid robotics systems
- Implement ROS 2 communication patterns for robot control
- Design message passing architectures for multi-component robots
- Create control systems using ROS 2 services and actions
- Integrate humanoid-specific components using ROS 2 frameworks

## Module Structure

This module contains the following chapters:

- **Chapter 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals** - Core concepts and architecture
- **Chapter 2: Message Passing** - Communication between robot components
- **Chapter 3: Control Architectures** - Designing robot control systems
- **Chapter 4: Humanoid Integration** - Specific applications to humanoid systems

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Understanding of basic robotics concepts
- Familiarity with programming (preferably C++ or Python)
- Basic knowledge of Physical AI concepts from Module 1
- Understanding of system integration principles

## Getting Started

Begin with Chapter 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals to establish the foundational concepts for robot communication and control.
